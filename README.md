# Digital and Analog Clock using FPGA

### Author

### Abstract 
In the project, I and Ben built a dgital Clock  (24 HR & 12 HR),
Quad Seven Segment Display (QSSD) clock, analog clock, jumping and bouncing digital clock. All the clocks except QSSD clock were made to display on a screen through VGA port available on the FPGA board. The QSSD clock was visible on the LEDs present on the FPGA board. The project uses embedded programmed file to manipulate each pixcel of the screen. The specification of the screen was 800x600 at 60Hz.
